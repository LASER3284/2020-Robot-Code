# 2020-Robot-Code
Official Robot Code Release for the 2020 season, Infinite Recharge. Confirmed working with WPILib 2020.2.2,
REVRobotics 1.5.1, Phoenix 5.17.6, and Kauai Labs NavX 3.1.400.
Some features of this year (Upcoming!) are a 360 Vision-tracking turret, Path Following using the newly provided
classes, and LEDs driven from the RoboRIO which will actively change depending on the state of the robot.
### Branches
**"master" branch** contains most development and changes. All other branches will be forked from master,
then merged back in after testing.
<br>
**"vision" branch** contains our Vision code for running on the new Raspberry Pi 4, 4GB model, for 2020.
Everything has been moved back into 1 file for drag-and-drop compatibility with the WPILib Raspberry Pi image.
